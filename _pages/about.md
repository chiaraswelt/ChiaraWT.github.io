I am an "ideabubbler" - meaning ideas come to my mind like bubbles in sparkling water. My mind gets electrified when digging into new technologies, exploring the best strategy to harness its potential and manage its development from idea to market building on data. I am a digital nomad - working agile and lean is my nature. I constantly think about improvements and getting work done effectively.
